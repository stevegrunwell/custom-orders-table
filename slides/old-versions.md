## Handling "Classic" WooCommerce Installations

Note:

Another challenge is that not everyone is running the latest release of WooCommerce. For whatever reason, they're sticking to an earlier release, but they're still an active store.

We want to support as many people as possible with the plugin, but we can't do anything for pre-3.x stores and have to draw the line somewhere.
