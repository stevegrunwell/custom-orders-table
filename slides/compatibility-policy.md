### Compatibility Policy

* Latest two <u>major</u> releases of WordPress core
* Latest three <u>minor</u> releases of WooCommerce

Note:

We determined a sensible backwards compatibility policy:
- Latest two major versions of WordPress (5.2 and 5.1)
  — WordPress doesn't do semver
- Latest three minor versions of WooCommerce (3.7 back to 3.5)

Once WordPress 5.3 and WooCommerce 3.8 drop, we can drop support for PHP < 5.6!
- WordPress raised the minimum PHP version in 5.1
