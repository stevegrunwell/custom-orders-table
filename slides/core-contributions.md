Note:

Unfortunately, there are areas of WooCommerce that aren't covered very well by automated tests.

I started becoming a fairly active contributor on WooCommerce, submitting mostly test coverage
- More tests in WooCommerce core meant better coverage for our plugin

As a result, I'm in the top 50 contributors to WooCommerce core!
