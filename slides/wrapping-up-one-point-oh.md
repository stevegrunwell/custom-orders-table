Note:

Currently in v1.0.0 Release Candidate 3

What does it look like to get to a 1.0.0 release?
- Remember: order data is sacred.

My time and my team's time has been a big bottleneck
- Busy building other new features at Liquid Web
- Cleared out some big blocks of time over the next few weeks, expect movement
- Stability is more important than rushing it out
