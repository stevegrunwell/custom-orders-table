## Get involved!

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Install &amp; test Release Candidates
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Provide feedback, bug reports

Note:

Biggest constraint has been my time

Best way to help is to install and test release candidates.
- We've been running them under a watchful eye on a number of production sites with no issue

Make sure you're giving feedback: bug reports are hugely important, but so are numbers re: performance improvements.
