## Data portability

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Must be easy to import order data
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Must be easy to **export** order data, too

Note:

Moving data into custom tables needs to be easy for store owners; they shouldn't need to worry about how the data is stored, only that it exists and is accurate.

If a store decides that the plugin's not right for whatever reason, they should also be able to revert without losing anything.
