### Core merger?

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Feature plugin to start
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Gather more data
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Seamless migrations

Note:

Treating the plugin as a WooCommerce extension to start, letting us iterate faster and collect more data

Goal is to eventually land in WooCommerce core, but in order to do so we need to make sure that every shop can use it
- Migrate existing orders via Action Scheduler
